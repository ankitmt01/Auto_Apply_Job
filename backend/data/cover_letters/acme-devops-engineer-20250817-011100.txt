Dear Hiring Team at Acme,

I’m excited to apply for the DevOps Engineer position. My background aligns closely with your needs, particularly around the areas highlighted in the job description.

A few relevant highlights:
• Designed and operated multi-account AWS foundation (VPC, Transit Gateway, IAM, KMS), enabling secure, compliant environments across 5 teams.
• Built GitOps-based Kubernetes platform (EKS + ArgoCD/Helm) to deploy 5 services; cut lead time to production by 30%.
• Codified infra with Terraform modules; delivered repeatable, reviewable changes and reduced drift incidents by 30%.

I value pragmatic automation, clear SLOs, and collaborative delivery with security as a first principle. I’d welcome the chance to talk through how I can help your team achieve its goals.

Best regards,
Ankit Gupta
