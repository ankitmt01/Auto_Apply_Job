Dear Hiring Team at stripe,

I’m excited to apply for the Account Executive, Enterprise position. My background aligns closely with your needs, particularly around the areas highlighted in the job description.

A few relevant highlights:
• Closed $$30 new ARR across 5 logos in last year, exceeding quota by {Y}%.
• Drove 5 multi-stakeholder evaluations; advanced 60% to proof-of-value with crisp success criteria.
• Expanded 5 existing accounts with {Y}% net revenue retention via value-based renewal motions.

I value pragmatic automation, clear SLOs, and collaborative delivery with security as a first principle. I’d welcome the chance to talk through how I can help your team achieve its goals.
