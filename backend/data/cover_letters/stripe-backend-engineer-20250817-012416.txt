Dear Hiring Team at stripe,

I’m excited to apply for the Backend Engineer position. My background aligns closely with your needs, particularly around the areas highlighted in the job description.

A few relevant highlights:
• Designed and shipped 5 microservices with SLOs; reduced p95 latency by 30%.
• Built event-driven features with Kafka and idempotent consumers; eliminated duplicate processing.
• Hardened data layer (Postgres) with migrations and read replicas; improved availability.

I value pragmatic automation, clear SLOs, and collaborative delivery with security as a first principle. I’d welcome the chance to talk through how I can help your team achieve its goals.

Best regards,
Ankit Gupta
