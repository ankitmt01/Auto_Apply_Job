Dear Hiring Team,

I'm excited to apply for the Account Executive, Enterprise (New Business)  role at stripe. My background combines hands-on delivery and systems thinking, and I’ve shipped ML features end-to-end in production.

Highlights aligned with the role requirements:
- Built NLP classifier (F1 0.92) on 5M docs using DistilBERT
- Cut inference cost by 32% via batching & INT8 quantization

I value clear metrics, reliable pipelines, and partnering closely with product and infra. I’d love to contribute that same impact to your team. Links and résumé attached.

Best regards,
Your Name
